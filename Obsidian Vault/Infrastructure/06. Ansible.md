Example of folder structure:
```shell

staging                   # inventory file for staging environment

group_vars/
   group1.yml             # here we assign variables to particular groups
   group2.yml
host_vars/
   hostname1.yml          # here we assign variables to particular systems
   hostname2.yml

library/                  # if any custom modules, put them here (optional)
module_utils/             # if any custom module_utils to support modules, put them here (optional)
filter_plugins/           # if any custom filter plugins, put them here (optional)

site.yml                  # main playbook
webservers.yml            # playbook for webserver tier
dbservers.yml             # playbook for dbserver tier
tasks/                    # task files included from playbooks
    webservers-extra.yml  # <-- avoids confusing playbook with task files
roles/
    common/               # this hierarchy represents a "role"
        tasks/            #
            main.yml      #  <-- tasks file can include smaller files if warranted
        handlers/         #
            main.yml      #  <-- handlers file
        templates/        #  <-- files for use with the template resource

        vars/             #
            main.yml      #  <-- variables associated with this role
        defaults/         #

        module_utils/     # roles can also include custom module_utils
        lookup_plugins/   # or other types of plugins, like lookup in this case

    webtier/              # same kind of structure as "common" was above, done for the webtier role
```
### Ansible Extra Variables

Can modify variables defined into a playbook by using `--extra-vars` at command execution.
Extra vars:
+ Assignment: `--extra-vars "[var_name]=[new_value]"`
+ JSON: `--extra-vars '{"[var_name]":"[new_value]"}'`
+ JSON/YAML file: `--extra-vars "@[filename].json"`
### Ansible multi-line

Writing a variable on multiple lines can be done by adding a `literal block scalar` or `folded block scalar`
+ `literal block scalar` `|` : It keeps the new lines, therefore will add `\\n` after each line
+ `folded block scalar` `>` : It puts everything on a single line
+ Remove the last `\\n` :  `|-` and `>-`
Example
```yaml
vars:
  literal_block_scalar: |
    these lines
    will break
    on different lines
  folded_block_scalar: >
    but this one
    will appear
    as a single line
tasks:
  - name: Literal block scalar
    ansible.builtin.debug:
      msg: "{{ literal_block_scalar }}"
  - name: Folded block scalar
    ansible.builtin.debug:
      msg: "{{ folded_block_scalar }}"
```

Output
```json
/* Literal block scalar */
{
  "msg": "these lines\nwill break\non different lines\n"
}
/* Folded block scalar */
{
  "msg": "but this one will appear as a single line\n"
}
```

To print it on different lines can add `.split('\n')` variable name

## Playbook YAML

```yaml
 # Start of YAML file
---
  # Name of this script
- name: <play_name>
  
  # Name of host(s) where tasks will run
  hosts: <host/hosts_list>

  # Runs tasks as sudo
  become: yes

  # List of tasks. A task is one action
  tasks:
    # One task. Set name of task
    - name: <task_name>
      # Command to be executed on selected hosts.
      # Example command: date
      command: <command>

    # Another task
    - name: <task_name>
      service:
        name: httpd
        state: started

    
    - name: Install Nginx
        apt:
          name: nginx
          state: present
        tags: install
      # Executes only if statement is true
      when: <condition1> == <condition2> and <condition1> != <condition3>

    
    - name: Set file permissions
      file:
        # The path or directory to be managed
        path: <path/or/directory>
        # Sets the owner for the path
        owner: <name>
        # Sets the group for the path
        group: <group_name>
        # Sets the permission for the path
        # Example '0777' full access
        mode: <access>
        # Ensures the path is the state
        # Example directory. Checks that the path is a directory
        state: <state>
      tags: set_permissions

    - name: <task_name>
      #
      lineinfile:
        # Path to file
        path: <path/to/file>
        # Line of text to be added to file if it doesn't exist
        line: <line>
      
```

### Condition

```yaml
when: a == b
```

### Loop

```yaml
---
- name: Update apt cache
  apt:
    update_cache: yes

- name: Install common packages
  apt:
    name: "{{ item }}"
    state: present

  # Will execute the tasks for each {{ item }} inside of loop
  # or with_items:
  loop:
    - curl
    - git
    - vim
```

```yaml
roles
```

Example
```yaml
---
- name: Example playbook
  hosts: all
  vars:
    my_variable: "my test"
    my_bool: true
    my_list:
      - Potato
      - Tomato

  tasks:
    - name: Print variable
      ansible.builtin.debug:
        msg: "The value of my_variable is: {{ my_variable }}"

    - name: Condition
      ansible.builtin.debug:
        msg: "Condition is true"
        when: my_bool

    - name: Print a list
      ansible.builtin.debug:
        var: item
      loop: "{{ my_list }}"

    - name: Notify handler on condition
      ansible.builtin.debug:
        msg: "Condition is true and will call the handler"
      notify: my_handler
      when: my_variable == "my test" AND my_bool == true
  
  handlers:
    - name: my_handler
      ansible.builtin.debug:
        msg: "My handler was notified"
