`sudo apt install docker.io`
`sudo systemctl status docker`
+ If the service is not enabled and started run:
	+ `sudo systemctl enable docker`
	+ `sudo systemclt start docker`

Add user to docker group so there is no need to run `sudo` for `docker` commands:
+ `sudo usermod -aG docker <username>`
+ Log out will be needed to reevaluate group membership

Test that it is working
`docker run hello-world`

## docker-compose

`sudo apt install docker-compose`
